# Load balancer overview

PgDog understands the PostgreSQL wire protocol and uses its SQL parser to understand queries. This allows it to split read queries from write queries and distribute traffic evenly between databases.

Applications can connect to a single PgDog [endpoint](#single-endpoint), without having to manually manage multiple connection pools.

## How it works

When a query is received by PgDog, it will inspect it using the native Postgres SQL parser. If the query is a `SELECT` and the [configuration](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/databases.md) contains both primary and replica databases, PgDog will send it to one of the replicas. For all other queries, PgDog will send them to the primary.

Applications don't have to manually route queries between databases or maintain several connection pools internally.

!!! note "SQL compatibility"
    PgDog's query parser is powered by the `pg_query` library, which extracts the Postgres native SQL parser directly from its source code. This makes it **100% compatible** with the PostgreSQL query language and allows PgDog to understand all valid PostgreSQL queries.

## Load distribution

The load balancer is configurable and can distribute read queries between replicas using one of the following strategies:

* [Round robin](#round-robin) (default)
* [Random](#random)
* [Least active connections](#least-active-connections)

Choosing the best strategy depends on your query workload and the size of the databases. Each strategy has its pros and cons. If you're not sure, using the **round robin** strategy usually works well for most deployments.

### Round robin

Round robin is often used in HTTP load balancers (e.g., nginx) to evenly distribute requests between hosts, in the same order as they appear in the configuration. Each database receives exactly one transaction before the next one is used.

This algorithm makes no assumptions about the capacity of each database or the cost of each query. It works best when all queries have similar runtime cost and replica databases have identical hardware.

##### Configuration

Round robin is used **by default**, so no config changes are required. You can still set it explicitly in [pgdog.toml](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/general.md), like so:

```toml
[general]
load_balancing_strategy = "round_robin"
```

### Random

The random strategy sends queries to a database based on the output of a random number generator modulus the number of replicas in the configuration. This strategy assumes no knowledge about the runtime cost of queries or the capacity of database hardware.

This algorithm is often effective when queries have unpredictable runtime. By randomly distributing them between databases, it reduces hot spots in the replica cluster.

##### Configuration

```toml
[general]
load_balancing_strategy = "random"
```

### Least active connections

Least active connections sends queries to replica databases that appear to be least busy serving other queries. This uses the [`sv_idle`](../../administration/pools.md) connection pool metric and assumes that pools with a high number of idle connections have more available resources.

This algorithm is useful when you want to "bin pack" the replica cluster. It assumes that queries have different runtime performance and attempts to distribute load more intelligently.

##### Configuration

```toml
[general]
load_balancing_strategy = "least_active_connections"
```


## Single endpoint

The load balancer can split reads (`SELECT` queries) from write queries. If it detects that a query is _not_ a `SELECT`, like an `INSERT` or an `UPDATE`, that query will be sent to the primary database. This allows PgDog to proxy an entire PostgreSQL cluster without requiring separate read and write endpoints.

This strategy is effective most of the time and the load balancer can handle several edge cases.

### SELECT FOR UPDATE

The most common edge case is `SELECT FOR UPDATE` which locks rows for exclusive access. Much like the name suggests, it's often used to update the selected rows, which is a write operation.

The load balancer detects this and will send this query to the primary database instead of a replica.

!!! note "Transaction required"

    `SELECT FOR UPDATE` is used inside manual [transactions](transactions.md) (i.e., started with `BEGIN`), which are routed to the primary database by default.

### Write CTEs

Some `SELECT` queries can trigger a write to the database from a CTE, for example:

```postgresql
WITH t AS (
  INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('test@test.com') RETURNING id
)
SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN t ON t.id = users.id
```

The load balancer recursively checks CTEs and, if any of them contains a query that could trigger a write, it will send the whole statement to the primary database.

## Using the load balancer

The load balancer is **enabled by default** when more than one database with the same `name` property is configured in [pgdog.toml](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/databases.md), for example:

```toml
[[databases]]
name = "prod"
role = "primary"
host = "10.0.0.1"

[[databases]]
name = "prod"
role = "replica"
host = "10.0.0.2"
```

## Primary reads

The [`read_write_split`](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/general.md#read_write_split) setting controls how read queries are distributed between the primary and its replicas. Write queries always route to the primary.

In the tables below, **"Replicas healthy"** means at least one replica is healthy — reads are routed to healthy replicas even if other replicas are down. **"Replicas down"** means all replicas are down or banned.

### `include_primary`

The default mode. The primary serves both reads and writes alongside the replicas. This maximizes the use of existing hardware and prevents overloading a replica when it is first added to the database cluster.

| Scenario | Writes | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| Primary healthy + Replicas healthy | Primary | Primary + Replicas |
| Primary healthy + Replicas down | Primary | Primary |
| Primary down + Replicas healthy | Unavailable | Replicas |
| Primary down + Replicas down | Unavailable | Unavailable |

```toml
[general]
read_write_split = "include_primary"  # default
```

### `exclude_primary`

All reads go to replicas only; the primary handles writes exclusively. Use this to isolate primary capacity for writes.

| Scenario | Writes | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| Primary healthy + Replicas healthy | Primary | Replicas |
| Primary healthy + Replicas down | Primary | Unavailable |
| Primary down + Replicas healthy | Unavailable | Replicas |
| Primary down + Replicas down | Unavailable | Unavailable |

```toml
[general]
read_write_split = "exclude_primary"
```

### `prefer_primary`

Reads go to the primary by default. Clients can opt specific reads into replicas using [manual routing](manual-routing.md) overrides (query comments, `SET LOCAL`, or `SET`). If all replicas are down, opted-in reads fall back to the primary.

| Scenario | Writes | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| Primary healthy + Replicas healthy | Primary | Primary |
| Primary healthy + Replicas down | Primary | Primary |
| Primary down + Replicas healthy | Unavailable | Replicas (failover) |
| Primary down + Replicas down | Unavailable | Unavailable |

```toml
[general]
read_write_split = "prefer_primary"
```

See [routing precedence](manual-routing.md#routing-precedence) for how overrides interact with this mode.

### `include_primary_if_replica_banned`

Reads go to replicas, but the primary becomes a read failover if **all** replicas are banned or down. This keeps the primary write-focused during normal operation while providing read availability during replica outages.

| Scenario | Writes | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| Primary healthy + Replicas healthy | Primary | Replicas |
| Primary healthy + Replicas down | Primary | Primary (failover) |
| Primary down + Replicas healthy | Unavailable | Replicas |
| Primary down + Replicas down | Unavailable | Unavailable |

```toml
[general]
read_write_split = "include_primary_if_replica_banned"
```

### Failover for reads

Two modes provide read failover to the primary when replicas are unavailable:

- **`include_primary_if_replica_banned`** — when all replicas are down, the primary automatically serves reads until replicas recover.
- **`prefer_primary`** — reads that have been opted into replicas via [manual routing](manual-routing.md#routing-precedence) overrides fall back to the primary when all replicas are down.
