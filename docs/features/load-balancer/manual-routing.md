# Manual routing

PgDog's load balancer uses the PostgreSQL parser to understand and route queries between the primary and replicas. If you want more control, you can provide the load balancer with hints, influencing its routing decisions.

This can be done on a per-query basis by using a comment, or on the entire client connection, with a session parameter.

## Query comments

If your query is replica-lag sensitive (e.g., you are reading data that you just wrote), you can route it to the primary manually. The load balancer supports doing this with a query comment:

```postgresql
/* pgdog_role: primary */ SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1
```

The `force-primary` and `force-replica` variants are also supported in query comments, allowing you to bypass the parser's read-eligibility check on a per-statement basis:

```postgresql
/* pgdog_role: force-replica */ CREATE TEMP TABLE scratch AS SELECT * FROM large_table
```

Query comments are supported in all types of queries, including prepared statements. If you're using the latter, the comments are parsed only once per client connection, removing any performance overhead of extracting them from the query.


## Parameters

Parameters are connection-specific settings that can be set on connection creation to configure database behavior. For example, this is how ORMs and web frameworks control settings like `application_name`, `statement_timeout` and many others.

The Postgres protocol doesn't have any restrictions on parameter names or values, and PgDog can intercept and handle them at any time.

The following two parameters allow you to control which database is used for all queries on a client connection:

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **`pgdog.role`** | Determines whether queries are sent to the primary database or the replica(s). |
| **`pgdog.shard`** | Determines which shard the queries are sent to. |

The `pgdog.role` parameter accepts the following values:

| Parameter value | Behavior | Example |
|-|-|-|
| `primary` | All queries are sent to the primary database. | `SET pgdog.role TO "primary"` |
| `replica` | All queries are load balanced between replica databases. In `include_primary` mode (default), the primary is included in read balancing. In `prefer_primary` mode, this is the opt-in mechanism for directing specific reads to replicas. See [`read_write_split`](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/general.md#read_write_split). | `SET pgdog.role TO "replica"` |
| `force-primary` | Routes to the primary regardless of statement type. Bypasses the read-eligibility check, so even statements the parser classifies as reads will be sent to the primary. | `SET pgdog.role TO "force-primary"` |
| `force-replica` | Routes to a replica regardless of statement type. Bypasses the read-eligibility check, so even non-read statements (e.g. `CREATE TEMP TABLE`) will be sent to a replica. | `SET pgdog.role TO "force-replica"` |

!!! note "Hyphen and underscore forms"
    Both hyphenated (`force-replica`) and underscored (`force_replica`) forms are accepted.

The `pgdog.shard` parameter accepts a shard number for any database specified in [`pgdog.toml`](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/databases.md), for example:

```postgresql
SET pgdog.shard TO 1;
```

### Setting the parameters

Configuring parameters can be done at connection creation, or by using the `SET` command. Below are examples of some of the common PostgreSQL drivers and web frameworks.

#### Database URL

Most PostgreSQL client libraries support the database URL format and can accept connection parameters as part of the URL. For example, when using `psql`, you can set the `pgdog.role` parameter like so:

```
psql postgres://user:password@host:6432/db?options=-c%20pgdog.role%3Dreplica
```

Depending on the environment, the parameters may need to be URL-encoded, e.g., `%20` is a space and `%3D` is the equals (`=`) sign.

=== "asyncpg"

    [asyncpg](https://pypi.org/project/asyncpg/) is a popular PostgreSQL driver for asynchronous Python applications. It allows you to set connection parameters on connection setup:

    ```python
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(
        user="pgdog",
        password="pgdog",
        database="pgdog",
        host="10.0.0.0",
        port=6432,
        server_settings={
            "pgdog.role": "primary",
        }
    )
    ```

=== "SQLAlchemy"

    [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a Python ORM, which supports any number of PostgreSQL connection drivers. For example, if you're using `asyncpg`, you can set connection parameters as follows:

    ```python
    engine = create_async_engine(
        "postgresql+asyncpg://pgdog:pgdog@10.0.0.0:6432/pgdog",
        pool_size=20,
        # [...]
        connect_args={"server_settings": {"pgdog.role": "primary"}},
    )
    ```

=== "Rails / ActiveRecord"

    [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and ActiveRecord support passing connection parameters in the `database.yml` configuration file:

    ```yaml
    # config/database.yml
    production:
      adapter: postgresql
      database: pgdog
      username: user
      password: password
      host: 10.0.0.0
      options: "-c pgdog.role=replica -c pgdog.shard=0"
    ```

    These options are passed to the [`pg`](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg) driver. If you're using it directly, you can create connections like so:

    ```ruby
    require "pg"

    conn = PG.connect(
      host: "10.0.0.0",
      # [...]
      options: "-c pgdog.role=primary -c pgdog.shard=1"
    )
    ```

### Using `SET`

The PostgreSQL protocol supports changing connection parameters using the `SET` statement. By extension, this also works for changing `pgdog.role` and `pgdog.shard` settings.

For example, to make sure all subsequent queries are sent to the primary, you can execute the following statement:

```postgresql
SET "pgdog"."role" TO "primary";
```

The parameter is persisted on the connection until it's closed or the value is changed with another `SET` statement. Before routing a query, the load balancer will check the value of this parameter, so setting it early on during connection creation ensures all transactions are executed on the right database.

To clear the connection-level override and revert reads to the config default, use `RESET`:

```postgresql
RESET "pgdog"."role";
```

#### Inside transactions

It's possible to set routing hints for the lifetime of a single transaction, by using the `SET LOCAL` command. This ensures the routing hint is used for one transaction only and doesn't affect the rest of the queries:

```postgresql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL "pgdog"."role" TO "primary";
```

In this example, all transaction statements (including the `BEGIN` statement) will be sent to the primary database. Whether the transaction is committed or reverted, the value of `pgdog.role` will be reset to its previous value.

!!! note "Statement ordering"
    To make sure PgDog intercepts the routing hint early enough in the transaction flow, you need to send all hints _before_ executing actual queries.

    The following flow, for example, _will not_ work:

    ```postgresql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1;
    SET LOCAL pgdog.role TO "primary"; -- The client is already connected to a server.
    INSERT INTO users (id) VALUES ($1); -- If connected to a replica, this will fail.
    ```



## Routing precedence

When multiple routing mechanisms are active, PgDog resolves them using a 4-layer precedence system — the highest-priority mechanism wins:

| Priority | Mechanism | Scope | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | Query comment | Single statement | `/* pgdog_role: replica */ SELECT ...` (also supports `force-primary` / `force-replica`) |
| 2 | Transaction parameter | Single transaction | `SET LOCAL pgdog.role = 'replica'` |
| 3 | Connection parameter | All reads on the connection | `SET pgdog.role = 'replica'` |
| 4 (lowest) | Config default | All reads in the pool | `read_write_split` mode setting |

A query comment overrides everything. A transaction parameter (`SET LOCAL`) overrides the connection parameter and config default for the duration of a single transaction — once the transaction commits or rolls back, the value reverts to the connection-level setting. A connection parameter overrides only the config default.

!!! note "Failover"
    In `prefer_primary` mode, overrides that opt a read into replicas still keep the primary as the final failover target: if all replicas are down or banned, that read falls back to the primary when one is available.

## Disabling the parser

In certain situations, the overhead of parsing queries may be too high, e.g., when your application can't use prepared statements.

If you've configured the desired database role (and/or shard) for each of your application connections, you can disable the query parser in [`pgdog.toml`](../../configuration/pgdog.toml/general.md#query_parser):

```toml
[general]
query_parser = "off"
```

Once it's disabled, PgDog will rely solely on the `pgdog.role` and `pgdog.shard` parameters to make its routing decisions.

### Session state & `SET`

The query parser is used to intercept and interpret `SET` commands. If the parser is disabled and your application uses `SET` commands to configure the connection, PgDog will not be able to guarantee that all connections have the correct session settings in [transaction mode](../transaction-mode.md).
